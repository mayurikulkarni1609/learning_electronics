# Learning Electronics

This repository contains my practice work while learning
basic electronics and circuit theory.

It includes:
- Fundamental component concepts (resistors, capacitors, etc.)
- Circuit realizations and simulations
- Notes, experiments, and small implementations

Individual folders or files focus on specific topics.
