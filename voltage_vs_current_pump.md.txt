# Voltage vs Current in a DC pump (how my model
broke and rebuilt)

This realization came from me being confused for
longer than I'd like to admit.

Initially, my thinking was very simple:
- it's a 5V DC pump
- therefore it needs 5V
- current didn't really matter to me

Voltage felt like the *requirement*.
Current felt like something the circuit would
automatically handle.

## Where things started going wrong

Then I had to use a boost converter.

The idea was:
- input voltage lower than 5V
- boost it to 5V
- then connect the pump

But boost converter modules don't magically
create power.
if voltage goes up, current goes down (roughly
constant power).

And suddenly:
- the output voltage was correct
- but the pump wouldn't run properly
- or it stalled
- or it behaved inconsistently

That confused me badly.

## The 1.5V moment that made it worse

At some point, I noticed the pump *did* run on a
single 1.5V cell.

That completely broke my "it needs 5V belief".

So my brain jumped to the opposite extreme:
- voltage doesn't matter much
- only current matters
- if enough current flows, the motor will run

This felt consistent for a while.
But it wasn't the full truth either.

## The realization (not sudden, but settling)

What finally made things click was understanding 
that:

- **Voltage and current do different jobs**
- They are not interchangable

Volatge:
- sets the speed
- sets the energy per charge
- is tied to back EMF in motors

Current:
- sets torque
- increases when load increases
- is what actually produces force

So:
- a motor can *run* at lower voltage, but slower 
and weaker
- forcing voltage without enough current
capability doesn't help
- forcing current without sufficient voltage
doesn't make sense either

Both matter, but in different ways.

---

## What in understand now (still evolving)

- Rated voltage is about intended operating
point, not a hard on/off rule
- Boosting voltage at the cost of current can
starve torque
- A motor running is not equal to motor
running properly
- Thinking in terms of power, torque, speed, and 
limits matters more than labels

## Why I'm writing this

Because my mistake wasn't ignorance.
It was oversimplification.

I jumped from;
"voltage matters"
to
"current matters"
instead of asking:
*what does each one actually do?*

This is me recording that transition so I don't
forget it.
